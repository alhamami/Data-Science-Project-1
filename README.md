## Installations <a name="installation"></a>
This project using python 3 and the following is the libraries tha are needed to be imported
- numpy: Which stands for Numerical Python, is a Python library primarily used for working with arrays and to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on them.
- pandas: is a data wrangling platform for Python widely adopted in the scientific computing community. pandas provides easy-to-use data ingestion, transformation, and export functions.
- sklearn: sklearn is a Python module integrating classical machine learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific Python packages. It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts: machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and engineering.
- matplotlib: Matplotlib is the powerhouse of data visualization for Python developers.

## Project Motivation <a name="ProjectMotivation"></a>
In this project, I was interested in answering three questions related to estimating whether a car is a good buy or a bad buy based on the posting
- What type of fuel do cars use the most according to Engine Power?
- What year was the newest car made?
- What is the average car price?

## File Descriptions <a name="FileDescriptions"></a>
There is notebook available here to showcase the work related to the above questions.
also there is CSV file containg the dataset that have been used.

## Result<a name="result"></a>
The main observations of the analysis can be found at this [post](https://medium.com/@jalalalhamami/processing-cars-data-to-facilitate-its-handling-and-benefit-a6a6b9b82cc4).
